# MSc Thesis
### Abstract 
The thesis is based on an analysis of the hypothesis, which states: the capital and property
structure of a company has an impact on its value. The claim will be tested using data that
every joint-stock company in Poland is required to make available.
The data from numerous companies, spanning a multitude of years and representing an
industry that undergoes constant change, may contain a considerable number of anoma-
lies. To identify and eliminate these anomalies, a number of fundamental machine learning
techniques were employed, including Local Outlier Factor, Isolation Forest, and One-Class
Support Vector Machine. Additionally, a neural network with an autoencoder architecture
was employed. The efficacy of these algorithms was examined visually through the use of
t-SNE and PCA methods. The quality of the prediction was also evaluated on the dataset
before and after the removal of anomalies.
The hypothesis analysis employed basic machine learning methods, including K-Nearest
Neighbours, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, and Logistic Regression. Additionally,
Deep learning methods, such as deep Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks,
were utilised. Prior to prediction, the data underwent scaling, transformation, and clean-
ing. For the Convolutional Network, Simulated Annealing was used in the transformation
of numerical data to images. This produces images optimised with respect to the mutual
distance and correlation of the variables. The problem is presented as both classification and
prediction, and the models are compared with each other using appropriate metrics.
The experiments demonstrate that the removal of the anomaly was performed correctly.
This action significantly improved the quality of the prediction. The results indicate that
enterprise value regression is too complex a task. Consequently, we presented the problem
as a classification. Upon analysis of the experiments, it was determined that they did not
provide sufficient evidence to confirm the hypothesis.
